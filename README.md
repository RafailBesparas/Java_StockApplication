# Java_StockApplication

Currently building my own crypto trading platform from scratch using real-time data from CoinGecko.
This is more than just a side project â€” itâ€™s my way of combining everything Iâ€™m learning in Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Crypto Trading into something real and functional.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m dedicating 2â€“3 hours daily to this, while also diving into Java and sharpening my technical + trading knowledge along the way.
Each feature is a hands-on lesson, and the goal? A fully functional, smart trading assistant.
